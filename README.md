 My 7th project: Image Gallery using React

 This single-page application is an image gallery that utilizes the React library, JSX syntax and the Create React App tool and React Router modules. Images are retrieved using the Fetch API from the Flickr API. An API key is required in order to fetch the data. The application's main functions are the gallery page that displays 25 images and a search function that retrieves images based on search queries.

 How to run:
 Download the project files and install project dependencies using npm install on your terminal. Launch the project from the main folder using npm start.
